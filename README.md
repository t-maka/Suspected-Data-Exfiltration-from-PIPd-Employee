# üîç Suspected-Data-Exfiltration-from-PIPd-Employee

## Scenario:
An employee named John Doe, working in a sensitive department, recently got put on a performance improvement plan (PIP). After John threw a fit, management has raised concerns that John may be planning to steal proprietary information and then quit the company. I was asked to investigate John's activities on his corporate device (lab-vm-mde) using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) and ensure nothing suspicious is taking place.

## üïí Timeline Summary and Findings

### üîπ Step 1: Initial Detection ‚Äì ZIP File Activity

We searched the **MDE `DeviceFileEvents`** table for any activity involving `.zip` files and observed frequent, routine actions involving file archiving and movement to a `backup folder`.

```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == "labwill-vm-mde"
| where FileName endswith ".zip"
| order by Timestamp desc
```

---

### üîπ Step 2: Investigating Archive Creation
We selected one instance where a ZIP file was created and correlated it with process activity 2 minutes before and after the event. A PowerShell script silently installed 7-Zip and used it to archive employee data.

üìÖ Timestamp: 2025-06-23T04:50:12.6573918Z

```kql
let VMName = "labwill-vm-mde";
let specificTime = datetime(2025-06-23T04:50:12.6573918Z);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between ((specificTime - 2m) .. (specificTime + 2m))
| where DeviceName == VMName
| order by Timestamp desc
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, ProcessCommandLine
```

### üîπ Step 3: Checking for Network Exfiltration
We examined the same time period for any signs of data exfiltration over the network, but found no suspicious activity in the logs.

```kql
let VMName = "labwill-vm-mde";
let specificTime = datetime(2025-06-23T04:50:12.6573918Z);
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp between ((specificTime - 2m) .. (specificTime + 2m))
| where DeviceName == VMName
| order by Timestamp desc
```
---

### üîπ Step 4: Checking for USB-Based Exfiltration
We also reviewed USB activity within a 30-minute window around the event. No suspicious USB device usage was detected.

```kql
let specificTime = datetime(2025-06-23T04:50:12.6573918Z);
let VMName = "labwill-vm-mde";
DeviceEvents
| where DeviceName == VMName
| where Timestamp between ((specificTime - 30m) .. (specificTime + 30m))
| where ActionType == "UsbDriveMounted" or ActionType == "DriveMounted"
| order by Timestamp desc
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ReportId, InitiatingProcessAccountName, AdditionalFields
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Response
- Immediate Action: Promptly isolated the system after identifying the suspicious archiving activity.
- Communication: Shared findings with the employee‚Äôs manager, including details about the PowerShell script creating archives at regular intervals.
- Result: No clear evidence of data exfiltration was found, but proactive measures were taken.

### üîß Improvement
Goal: Strengthen security posture and improve future threat hunting processes.

### üõ†Ô∏è Preventative Measures:
- Application Control: Restrict unauthorized tools like 7-Zip.
- PowerShell Logging: Ensure script block and module logging is enabled.
- DLP Tools: Deploy rules to flag suspicious archiving or bulk file access.

### üß™ Detection & Hunting Improvements:
- Behavioral Rules: Alert on recurring PowerShell archiving patterns.
- Baselining: Establish norms for ZIP file creation frequency.
